A Portland Coffee Shop Data Dashboard

BrewFinderPDX is a front-end React dashboard that helps users explore cafés and coffee shops around Portland, Oregon. The project uses public APIs to display location data, pricing insights, ratings, and trends through interactive charts and visualizations.

## Project Overview

This dashboard will include:

- A map of Portland cafés
- A searchable list of cafés with details
- Charts visualizing ratings, price trends, and neighborhood distribution
- A custom visualization (TBD — likely roast preferences, hours comparison, or foot-traffic indicators)

The goal is to build a clean, data-driven UI for discovering coffee spots in the city.

Install dependencies:
